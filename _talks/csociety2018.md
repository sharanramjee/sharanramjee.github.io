## Abstract
We discuss and provide an introduction to Deep Learning for Style Transfer. We delve into a myriad of Neural Style Transfer concepts like Adaptive Instance Normalization and other offer a Keras implementation of these various algorithms. We also provide a GUI to better explore style transfer effects enabled by mixing and matching some of these algorithms.
