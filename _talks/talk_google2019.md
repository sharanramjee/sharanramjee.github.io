## Abstract
* Worked with the Google Cloud AI team on using Model Distillation to create Explainable AI by generating rules that explain Deep Learning models
* Created a system to tune the complexity of rules generated, number of rules generated, and accuracy of the Deep Learning model
* Implemented Soft Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees to compare their trade-offs for Model Distillation
