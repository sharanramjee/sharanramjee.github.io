## Abstract
In this work, we propose a novel subsampling technique to facilitate the use of deep learning for automatic modulation classification in wireless communication systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on pre-designed strategies that are solely based on expert knowledge, the proposed Data Driven Subsampling strategy employs deep neural network architectures - that we call Subsampler Nets - to simulate the effect of removing candidate combinations of samples from each training input vector. The subsampled data is then processed by another deep learning classifier that recognizes each of the considered 10 modulation types. We show that the proposed subsampling strategy not only introduces drastic reduction in the classifier training time, but can also improve the classification accuracy to levels never reached before for the considered dataset. An important feature herein is exploiting the transferability of learning by showing that using a combination of Subsampler Nets delivers a superior performance to using only a single network in the combination.
