In this paper, we present a novel approach to enable the use of low-resolution cameras for automated pothole detection through the use of super-resolution (SR) via Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs). We then proceed to establish the baseline pothole detection performances on low-resolution and high-resolution dashcam images using a YOLO network. Finally, we demonstrate and analyze the pothole detection performance gain achieved over the baselines by applying super-resolution on the low-resolution dashcam images.
