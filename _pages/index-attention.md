I'm a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about bridging the gap between AI research and production systems. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science (AI concentration) from Stanford University and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Purdue University.

When I'm not training models, you'll find me inventing new cocktails, DJing house and techno, chasing waves surfing, or traveling to exotic destinations. If you'd like to chat about my work or anything else, feel free to reach out to me at sharanramjee [at] gmail [dot] com.
