excerpt: "ML Engineer | Stanford CS | Pushing the boundaries of AI"

Hello there! My name is Sharan, and I'm a forward-thinking Machine Learning Engineer passionate about pushing the boundary of possibilities through cutting-edge AI. My expertise spans broadly across the field - from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to Graph Learning (GL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

At Stripe, I work on maintaining the intricate balance between fraud losses and user experience. I led a team to build Project Scorpion - Stripe's first time-series transformer model for fraud detection.

I graduated from Stanford University with a Master of Science in Computer Science (AI concentration) and from Purdue University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering.
