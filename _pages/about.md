I am a Master's student specializing in Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in 2020.

I work on robot learning for intuitive human-robot interaction using Computer Vision at the [Stanford Vision and Learning Lab (SVL)](http://svl.stanford.edu/) advised by [Silvio Savarese](https://cvgl.stanford.edu/silvio/). I was an undergraduate researcher at [Aly El Gamal](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~elgamala/)'s research lab at Purdue, where I worked on Deep Learning for Signal Processing and Wireless Communications with a focus on Modulation Classification and Interference Identification.

During my academic endeavors, I interned at Google in Fall 2019 as a Software Engineering Intern as a part of the [Google Cloud AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai) team, where I worked on using Model Distillation to create [Explainable AI](https://cloud.google.com/explainable-ai). I also interned at Qualcomm in Summer 2019 as a Machine Learning Intern as a part of the Machine Learning Analysis division of the System Performance team, where I worked on using temporal Deep Learning models to mitigate power loss in Snapdragon chips by optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) parameters when encoding/decoding videos.
