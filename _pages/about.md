I am a Machine Learning Engineer working at Stripe with the Fraud Discovery Team in San Francisco on developing Machine Learning models for merchant fraud discovery.

I obtained my Master of Science in Computer Science degree with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence from the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) in 2022. Prior to Stanford University, I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in 2020.

During my time at Stanford University, I worked on robot learning for intuitive human-robot interaction using Computer Vision at the Stanford Vision and Learning Lab (SVL). Furthermore, during the Summer 2020 term, I worked as a Research Assistant at the MIT Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), where I worked on bridging the gap between human intelligence and machine intelligence. Finally, during my time at Purdue University, I was an undergraduate researcher at [Aly El Gamal](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~elgamala/)'s research lab, where I worked on Deep Learning for Signal Processing and Wireless Communications with a focus on Modulation Classification and Interference Identification.

Apart from my academic endeavors, I interned at Stripe in Summer 2021 as a Software Engineering Intern as a part of the Merchant Fraud Intelligence team, where I worked on ML fraud modeling for Stripe merchants. Furthermore, I interned at Google in Fall 2019 as a Software Engineering Intern as a part of the [Google Cloud AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai) team, where I worked on using Model Distillation to create [Explainable AI](https://cloud.google.com/explainable-ai). Finally, I interned at Qualcomm in Summer 2019 as a Machine Learning Intern as a part of the Machine Learning Analysis division of the System Performance team, where I worked on using temporal Deep Learning models to mitigate power loss in Snapdragon chips by optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) parameters when encoding/decoding videos.
