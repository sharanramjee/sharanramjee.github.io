I am a Master's student in Computer Science with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence at the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). Previously, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) in 2020.

During the Summer 2020 term, I worked as a Research Assistant at the MIT Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), where I worked on bridging the gap between human intelligence and machine intelligence. During my time at Purdue University, I was an undergraduate researcher at [Aly El Gamal](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~elgamala/)'s research lab, where I worked on Deep Learning for Signal Processing and Wireless Communications with a focus on Modulation Classification and Interference Identification.

Apart from my academic endeavors, I interned at Google in Fall 2019 as a Software Engineering Intern as a part of the [Google Cloud AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai) team, where I worked on using Model Distillation to create [Explainable AI](https://cloud.google.com/explainable-ai). I also interned at Qualcomm in Summer 2019 as a Machine Learning Intern as a part of the Machine Learning Analysis division of the System Performance team, where I worked on using temporal Deep Learning models to mitigate power loss in Snapdragon chips by optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) parameters when encoding/decoding videos.

This Summer 2021 term, I will be interning at Stripe in San Francisco, where I will be working on Machine Learning for payment fraud detection.
