* Vitamin.AI is a Computer Vision driven health & fitness tracking Android App that is an upgrade to FitScan, another android app I made in 2017 [LINK](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.corp.hypnotrix.fitscan&hl=en_US)
* Uses Google Cloud Vision API to classify brand names and AR to detect the size/calories of the products consumed
* Automatically schedules a run for the user using Google Maps APIs so that the user burns the calories that were consumed on that day
